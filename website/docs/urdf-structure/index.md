# Robot Structure with URDF

## Modeling Robots: Links, Joints, and Kinematics

This chapter focuses on URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), the standard for describing robot models in ROS. We'll explore how to model robot structures, including links, joints, and kinematics, with special attention to humanoid robots and their integration with ROS 2.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the structure of URDF files
- Define robot links and joints in URDF
- Describe kinematic relationships in robot models
- Create humanoid robot models using URDF
- Integrate URDF models with ROS 2 systems

### Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should:
- Have completed Chapters 1 and 2 (ROS 2 concepts and Python agents)
- Understand basic concepts of robotics and mechanics
- Be familiar with XML syntax (URDF is XML-based)
