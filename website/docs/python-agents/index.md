# Python Agents with ROS 2

## Bridging Python and ROS 2

This chapter focuses on using Python with ROS 2, specifically through the `rclpy` library. We'll explore how to create ROS 2 nodes using Python and how to bridge AI agents with ROS 2 control systems.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create ROS 2 nodes using Python and the `rclpy` library
- Implement publishers, subscribers, and services in Python
- Understand how to integrate AI agents with ROS 2 systems
- Design basic integration patterns between Python AI code and ROS 2 control

### Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should:
- Have completed Chapter 1 (Introduction to ROS 2 concepts)
- Be comfortable with Python programming
- Understand basic AI concepts (agents, decision making, etc.)
